## Definitions

- **Oscillator** is an amplifier whose output is connected back to its own input

## Notes

For oscillation to occur certain conditions must be met:

- transistor must have enough gain (amplification)
  - to overcome feedback losses
- feedback must be in the correct phase
  - must be positive feedback

To obtain the correct feedback to ensure oscillation:

- Mutual inductance (transformer action) between the coils in the input and output circuits
- Feedback circuit from output to input
- Tapped coil. Part of the coil is in the input circuit and part of the coil is in the output circuit.
