## Practical considerations for your station:

- Antennas are a vital item in your station!
  - Consider how you would want to install an antenna:
    - How would you ground the antenna?
    - How would you install the antenna without compromising safety? (Especially for antennas sticking out a building)
    - Can a person unwittingly come into contact with the antenna while it is in use?
  - Matching antennas:
    - If you are using a reduced size antenna, consider a proper impedance matching method like an antenna tuner or RF transformer.
       - This will help to ensure maximum power transfer from your radio to your antenna.
