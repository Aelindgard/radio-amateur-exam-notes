# 9. Power Amplifier

> TODO: work in progress

## Definitions

- **Power Amplifier** takes the output from the exciter which is usually very low and amplifies the signal before passing it to the aerial
- **Flywheel** is a tuned circuit where pulses of current through the PA transistor make up for the losses in the tuned circuit and create an output comprising complete cycles
- **Modulation** is the process of impressing speech on to the carrier wave
- **ATU** is aerial tuning unit is a device connected between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching the impedance of the radio to the antennaâ€™s feedline.

### Power Amplifier

- no frequency change within a P.A.
- very important to ensure that self- oscillation does not take place
- must be carefully designed to avoid any positive feedback
- usually operated in Class C to give the best efficiency
  - passes the current for less than 50% of each cycle
  - acts like a flywheel
